# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Joined the 100 days of code challenge and built calculator using JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: I'm gonna use this opportunity to improve my coding skills and learn JavaScript. This is going to be fun! I also managed to get my calculator to work and need to improve its looks. I think I found a tiny bit of JavaScript patterns.

### Day 1: June 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS and changed the colors of background, display, and buttons.

**Thoughts**: I have learn how tr and td tags in HTML works and it was interesting. I should've put the table tag or these tags won't work. I have yet to figure out how to set custom errors in JavaScript when a user put incorrect inputs.

### Day 2: June 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Not much done. Just reading someone's code.

**Thoughts**: I tried to find ways to get my calculator to display syntax error with no luck. Found myself spending more time on reading someone's code to understand how it works than writing actual codes. I should've clone the codes earlier before the practice time and then break them all into pieces to get the gist of it. No biggie - it's slow day for me.

### Day 3: June 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Reading other people's codes and break it to study its effects.

**Thoughts**: While today I haven't code much, I had fun breaking people's codes and understand how their codes works. Apparently, you can use the header element in HTML to create display screen for the calculator. It was an interesting discovery to say the least.

### Day 4: June 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did some basic JavaScript exercises on FreeCodeCamp to refresh my knwoledge.

**Thoughts**: Yesterday, I joined the CareerDev mentorship program and my new mentor, Steve helped him greatly. It didn't occured to me that I can use console log to analysis what my code is doing under the hood. While I have no idea how it works right now, I'm sure it make a big differences in getting better my coding skills.

### Day 5: June 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did some more JavaScript challenges in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I finally understood why I'm having trouble learning JavaScript. It's because I have no practical uses for it yet, unlike HTML and CSS. From now on, I'll just focus on learning the most basics features used mainly for front-end development.

### Day 6: June 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practicing JavaScript functions by creating dynamic paragraph.

**Thoughts**: I did a very simple task of changing the colors and font size of paragraph using JavaScript functions. Still not easy, however for the first time in a while, I'm actually enjoying this.

### Day 7: June 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Successfully built a simple task of making dynamic paragraph.

**Thoughts**: I cannot believe myself! I actually managed to change the sizes, font style, colors, and position of the paragraph without looking up a tutorial! I only read a guide, played a little bit, came up a tiny task and made it one. Now, I begin to understand a little bit of how to change HTML/CSS using the function feature in JavaScript.

### Day 8: June 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practicing JavaScript functions and learning little bit of console.log.

**Thoughts**: I added a default button that will return changed paragraph to its original form. Seeing how I make this worked through copying snippets of my code then tweaking only the necessary parts and seeing all come out a live is quite satisfying.

### Day 9: June 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practicing JavaScript event listener and begin to build personal website.

**Thoughts** Not gonna lie, I can't tell the difference between eventListener and functions. To me, it seems like they do the same thing, and the differences is the ways of typing the code. I need to explore it more.

### Day 10: June 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still practicing JavaScript event listener.

**Thoughts**: Uhhhhh...nope. I still have no idea what event listener is supposed to do. I guess I should look up the reference for a while. In the meantime, my own website still looking funny and too cringy to post a link in GitHub. Gotta fix 'em later.

### Day 11: June 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: And yet, still practicing JavaScript event listener. But there's progress!

**Thoughts**: And the progress is... while the function and eventlistener do the same thing, the difference is in eventlistener, you don't need to put onclick attribute in HTML since the "Click" in JavaScript will take care in its place (Not that I know why click here is necessary. It gives "syntax error: expecting expression but got ," error message). On unrelated notes, I understood the purpose of const variable - you can change variable names with var or let, but const won't allow you.

### Day 12: June 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Played a little bit of variables today.

**Thoughts**: After tackling functions for a few days, I'm now trying to understand how does the variables works. Outside of storing user data, I want to know where else should I use these variables. This is going to be my next focus point of coding.

Projects? No - no yet. Maybe next month.

### Day 13: June 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Start practicing if statements.

**Thoughts**: Feeling tired today and made no progress in my calculator again. At least, I have a rough idea on where to look for solutions, so I'll take a rest.

**Update**: Change of plans: I'm gonna create a notes app and trying a new approach of solving my coding problems. This new thought has completely energized me and I will make this new project successfil no matter what!!

### Day 14: June 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Creating a simple story using event handlers.

**Thoughts**:I had this weird idea of making a silly game using every tools of JavaScript I learnt so far. It will look pointless from user's point of view, but it should help me get better of JavaScript.

### Day 15: June 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished creating the intro stage of the game.

**Thoughts**: I created another project called the JS Dojo - which is a storytelling game where the player have to make the right choice to procced the story. The best part of the day is how I created a small problem and actually solved on my own. The problem itself may be seems to be trivial, but I liked how I managed to fix it by myself.

### Day 16: June 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished creating the intro stage of the game.

**Thoughts**: Creating something that's random is fun. I have 4 more stages to go before posting a link to the game.

### Day 17: June 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: started creating stage 1 of the game.

**Thoughts**: I spend 15 minutes debugging error and the solution is fixing my typo - good. And now, I got a new error that won't allow my button to work. I think I got a lot of work to do.

### Day 18: June 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished creating the first stage of the game.

**Thoughts**: My codes looked so terrible that even a monkey can do this. The game is working as I intended, but I cannot help thinking that there are better ways I can do. I should probably ask someone for their opinion in the future. For now, I'll procced to stage 2 of the game.

### Day 19: June 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working on the second stage of the game.

**Thoughts**: My git files have failed to push into GitHub because the repo has changed inside the GitHub. Luckily, all I have to do is to pull the files from GitHub and then push it again. Lesson learned.

### Day 20: June 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixing if statement conditions in second stage of the game.

**Thoughts**: Errors.. errors.. and more errors! My code is not working and made no significant progress. To be fair, I was slacking off by browsering interesting, but unrelated articles and forums. I did however formed a hypothesis on why my code didn't not worked and I will search for the answers.

### Day 21: July 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed if statement conditions in second stage of the game.

**Thoughts**: I asked a question on Stack Overflow to find out why my code didn't work and learned the follow reasons:
1. I wrote if statement condition outside of the function outside.
2. The function contains variables so it will never work outside the code.
3. In if statement condition, I used "=" instead of "==".

Thanks to the nice people on the internet, I have uncovered what I don't know and it's time to read guides especially the "=" thing.

### Day 22: July 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started building third stage of the game.

**Thoughts** Got nothing much to say. Just learning the difference between setTimeout and setInterval.

### Day 23: July 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Got the progress bar working for third stage of the game.

**Thoughts** Alright, I managed to make the progress bar more dynamic and all is left is to make bar go from right to left. On another note, I noticed the intervals are firing multiple times in the console.log and I don't like that. I guess I have more things to fix than originally planned.

Oh, well... whatever.

### Day 24: July 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Changed the progress bar transitions from right to left.

**Thoughts** I was wondering if there is a way to reverse the progress bar transition. Turns out yes and all I got to do is to float the bar to right in CSS. No JavaScript are involved.

### Day 25: July 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added some HTML elements and a button fuctionality for stage 3.

**Thoughts** I don't get why I cannot hide the "mission failed" message when I clicked the potion. I clearly stated the element to display none when user clicks drug button. Maybe, one function has override the other or something like that. I'm not really sure.

I'll see what I can do tomorrow when I have a fresh mind.

### Day 26: July 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Debugging a potion button fuctionality for stage 3.

**Thoughts** Using clearInterval() should not be problem if there is only variable. But since my code contain 3 variables, it's going to be tough to debug my code. I tried to put clearInterval() in each variable and it does not work at all. I have to find my way around this challenge.

### Day 27: July 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still debugging a potion button fuctionality for stage 3.

**Thoughts** I don't get it. Why is it giving me undefined errors when I placed a var inside the clearInterval() bracket line.
I really don't get it. 3 days to go before I goolge the answer.

### Day 28: July 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed a potion button bug fuctionality for stage 3.

**Thoughts** I fixed it by hiding each HTML element tags instead of stopping the bar transition itself. While I know this may sound like I did half-assed job, I promise I will return to fix it at another time.

### Day 29: July 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Changed the layout of the website.

**Thoughts** The internet is not working today so I used this opportunity to change the layout of the website to make it better.

### Day 30: July 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started buiding stage 4 of the game.

**Thoughts** The time counter is not working in stage 4 unless I put the code in HTML file or removed conditional codes of the stage 1. Maybe, it's something to do with the variables for the time counter. I need to find it out more.
