# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Joined the 100 days of code challenge and built calculator using JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: I'm gonna use this opportunity to improve my coding skills and learn JavaScript. This is going to be fun! I also managed to get my calculator to work and need to improve its looks. I think I found a tiny bit of JavaScript patterns.
