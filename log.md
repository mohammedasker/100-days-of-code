# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Joined the 100 days of code challenge and built calculator using JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: I'm gonna use this opportunity to improve my coding skills and learn JavaScript. This is going to be fun! I also managed to get my calculator to work and need to improve its looks. I think I found a tiny bit of JavaScript patterns.

### Day 1: June 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS and changed the colors of background, display, and buttons.

**Thoughts**: I have learn how tr and td tags in HTML works and it was interesting. I should've put the table tag or these tags won't work. I have yet to figure out how to set custom errors in JavaScript when a user put incorrect inputs.

### Day 2: June 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Not much done. Just reading someone's code.

**Thoughts**: I tried to find ways to get my calculator to display syntax error with no luck. Found myself spending more time on reading someone's code to understand how it works than writing actual codes. I should've clone the codes earlier before the practice time and then break them all into pieces to get the gist of it. No biggie - it's slow day for me.

### Day 3: June 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Reading other people's codes and break it to study its effects.

**Thoughts**: While today I haven't code much, I had fun breaking people's codes and understand how their codes works. Apparently, you can use the header element in HTML to create display screen for the calculator. It was an interesting discovery to say the least.

### Day 4: June 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did some basic JavaScript exercises on FreeCodeCamp to refresh my knwoledge.

**Thoughts**: Yesterday, I joined the CareerDev mentorship program and my new mentor, Steve helped him greatly. It didn't occured to me that I can use console log to analysis what my code is doing under the hood. While I have no idea how it works right now, I'm sure it make a big differences in getting better my coding skills.

### Day 5: June 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did some more JavaScript challenges in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I finally understood why I'm having trouble learning JavaScript. It's because I have no practical uses for it yet, unlike HTML and CSS. From now on, I'll just focus on learning the most basics features used mainly for front-end development.

### Day 6: June 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practicing JavaScript functions by creating dynamic paragraph.

**Thoughts**: I did a very simple task of changing the colors and font size of paragraph using JavaScript functions. Still not easy, however for the first time in a while, I'm actually enjoying this.

### Day 7: June 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Successfully built a simple task of making dynamic paragraph.

**Thoughts**: I cannot believe myself! I actually managed to change the sizes, font style, colors, and position of the paragraph without looking up a tutorial! I only read a guide, played a little bit, came up a tiny task and made it one. Now, I begin to understand a little bit of how to change HTML/CSS using the function feature in JavaScript.

### Day 8: June 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practicing JavaScript functions and learning little bit of console.log.

**Thoughts**: I added a default button that will return changed paragraph to its original form. Seeing how I make this worked through copying snippets of my code then tweaking only the necessary parts and seeing all come out a live is quite satisfying.

### Day 9: June 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practicing JavaScript event listener and begin to build personal website.

**Thoughts** Not gonna lie, I can't tell the difference between eventListener and functions. To me, it seems like they do the same thing, and the differences is the ways of typing the code. I need to explore it more.

### Day 10: June 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still practicing JavaScript event listener.

**Thoughts**: Uhhhhh...nope. I still have no idea what event listener is supposed to do. I guess I should look up the reference for a while. In the meantime, my own website still looking funny and too cringy to post a link in GitHub. Gotta fix 'em later.

### Day 11: June 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: And yet, still practicing JavaScript event listener. But there's progress!

**Thoughts**: And the progress is... while the function and eventlistener do the same thing, the difference is in eventlistener, you don't need to put onclick attribute in HTML since the "Click" in JavaScript will take care in its place (Not that I know why click here is necessary. It gives "syntax error: expecting expression but got ," error message). On unrelated notes, I understood the purpose of const variable - you can change variable names with var or let, but const won't allow you.

### Day 12: June 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Played a little bit of variables today.

**Thoughts**: After tackling functions for a few days, I'm now trying to understand how does the variables works. Outside of storing user data, I want to know where else should I use these variables. This is going to be my next focus point of coding.

Projects? No - no yet. Maybe next month.

### Day 13: June 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Start practicing if statements.

**Thoughts**: Feeling tired today and made no progress in my calculator again. At least, I have a rough idea on where to look for solutions, so I'll take a rest.

**Update**: Change of plans: I'm gonna create a notes app and trying a new approach of solving my coding problems. This new thought has completely energized me and I will make this new project successfil no matter what!!

### Day 14: June 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Creating a simple story using event handlers.

**Thoughts**:I had this weird idea of making a silly game using every tools of JavaScript I learnt so far. It will look pointless from user's point of view, but it should help me get better of JavaScript.

### Day 15: June 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished creating the intro stage of the game.

**Thoughts**: I created another project called the JS Dojo - which is a storytelling game where the player have to make the right choice to procced the story. The best part of the day is how I created a small problem and actually solved on my own. The problem itself may be seems to be trivial, but I liked how I managed to fix it by myself.

### Day 16: June 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished creating the intro stage of the game.

**Thoughts**: Creating something that's random is fun. I have 4 more stages to go before posting a link to the game.

### Day 17: June 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: started creating stage 1 of the game.

**Thoughts**: I spend 15 minutes debugging error and the solution is fixing my typo - good. And now, I got a new error that won't allow my button to work. I think I got a lot of work to do.

### Day 18: June 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished creating the first stage of the game.

**Thoughts**: My codes looked so terrible that even a monkey can do this. The game is working as I intended, but I cannot help thinking that there are better ways I can do. I should probably ask someone for their opinion in the future. For now, I'll procced to stage 2 of the game.

### Day 19: June 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working on the second stage of the game.

**Thoughts**: My git files have failed to push into GitHub because the repo has changed inside the GitHub. Luckily, all I have to do is to pull the files from GitHub and then push it again. Lesson learned.

### Day 20: June 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixing if statement conditions in second stage of the game.

**Thoughts**: Errors.. errors.. and more errors! My code is not working and made no significant progress. To be fair, I was slacking off by browsering interesting, but unrelated articles and forums. I did however formed a hypothesis on why my code didn't not worked and I will search for the answers.

### Day 21: July 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed if statement conditions in second stage of the game.

**Thoughts**: I asked a question on Stack Overflow to find out why my code didn't work and learned the follow reasons:
1. I wrote if statement condition outside of the function outside.
2. The function contains variables so it will never work outside the code.
3. In if statement condition, I used "=" instead of "==".

Thanks to the nice people on the internet, I have uncovered what I don't know and it's time to read guides especially the "=" thing.

### Day 22: July 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started building third stage of the game.

**Thoughts** Got nothing much to say. Just learning the difference between setTimeout and setInterval.

### Day 23: July 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Got the progress bar working for third stage of the game.

**Thoughts** Alright, I managed to make the progress bar more dynamic and all is left is to make bar go from right to left. On another note, I noticed the intervals are firing multiple times in the console.log and I don't like that. I guess I have more things to fix than originally planned.

Oh, well... whatever.

### Day 24: July 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Changed the progress bar transitions from right to left.

**Thoughts** I was wondering if there is a way to reverse the progress bar transition. Turns out yes and all I got to do is to float the bar to right in CSS. No JavaScript are involved.

### Day 25: July 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added some HTML elements and a button fuctionality for stage 3.

**Thoughts** I don't get why I cannot hide the "mission failed" message when I clicked the potion. I clearly stated the element to display none when user clicks drug button. Maybe, one function has override the other or something like that. I'm not really sure.

I'll see what I can do tomorrow when I have a fresh mind.

### Day 26: July 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Debugging a potion button fuctionality for stage 3.

**Thoughts** Using clearInterval() should not be problem if there is only variable. But since my code contain 3 variables, it's going to be tough to debug my code. I tried to put clearInterval() in each variable and it does not work at all. I have to find my way around this challenge.

### Day 27: July 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still debugging a potion button fuctionality for stage 3.

**Thoughts** I don't get it. Why is it giving me undefined errors when I placed a var inside the clearInterval() bracket line.
I really don't get it. 3 days to go before I goolge the answer.

### Day 28: July 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed a potion button bug fuctionality for stage 3.

**Thoughts** I fixed it by hiding each HTML element tags instead of stopping the bar transition itself. While I know this may sound like I did half-assed job, I promise I will return to fix it at another time.

### Day 29: July 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Changed the layout of the website.

**Thoughts** The internet is not working today so I used this opportunity to change the layout of the website to make it look better.

### Day 30: July 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started buiding stage 4 of the game.

**Thoughts** The time counter is not working in stage 4 unless I put the code in HTML file or removed conditional codes of the stage 1. Maybe, it's something to do with the variables for the time counter. I need to find it out more.

### Day 31: July 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started buiding stage 4 of the game.

**Thoughts** Okay, the time counter problem has been taken care by moving the code snippet inside the playgame function. Next, I need to figure out how to display the "you lose" message when the countdown timer reaches zero. Not easy of course, but it's doable.

### Day 32: July 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished buiding stage 4 of the game.

**Thoughts** I fixed problem of the "you lose" message not displaying when the countdown timer reaches zero. Once again, the reason is I put the code snippet in the wrong curly bracket again! When I think about this, it actually makes more sense because the logic flow are supposed to go in certain way. I can't explain myself clearly, but the point is I didn't pay attention.

Anyway, this game will be done within 3-4 days!

### Day 33: July 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Changing the layout of the website.

**Thoughts** Thank God for the developer tools! Without it, I would have a hard time fixing tiny mistakes. Actually, how did the developers used to fix bugs before developer tools was a thing? Hmmm......

### Day 34: July 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Changing the buttons layout in stage 1.

**Thoughts** I'm still trying to get used to CSS grid. Grid is cool and I may probably never touch flexbox, but whatever.

### Day 35: July 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed layout of intro stage and hide potion button when clicked.

**Thoughts** The game is almost ready to play and will show it to everyone on Twitter tomorrow. Also, I'm starting to get confident in writing JavaScript functions, innerHTML, Style, and if statement conditions. I like it how when I want to make small changes in my web game and have tweaked little bit of JS codes and worked exactly the way I want to. In other words, I begin to understand basics of JavaScript and I feel great!

### Day 36: July 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed answer buttons layout of stage 2.

**Thoughts** I think I'm almost done with the game project and I'm going to show it to everyone for the feedback. The project was not easy, but it was fun.

### Day 37: July 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Begin to build tribute page for Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** Man, the CDN link is not working. I need it in order to test my codes for the sake of completing the project and get the certificate and spend almost 1 hour without luck. Oh, well. Time to get some help.

On another note. I finished my mini project yesterday and it is still buggy with ugly UI. I'll return to it later after doing some FCC projects.

### Day 38: July 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Changed text contents, background colors, and font family of the tribute page.

**Thoughts** I'm such a silly person. Why did I used strong elements in HTML when I could simply use b elements to change the text style into bold? Anyways, the project itself is going fine, but I need to do something about the CDN link.

### Day 39: July 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Submitted tribute page and start doing second project of FFC web responsive design project.

**Thoughts** Okay, I managed to get CDN link working and have successfully submit the first project of the FFC. Now, I'm building the second project and it shouldn't take a long time to finish it.

### Day 40: July 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Submitted survey page and start doing third project of FFC web responsive design project.

**Thoughts** I finished the second project faster than I expected which is cool. The project looks okay, but I can make the page a lot better and will probably do it when I have extra time. Next, I will start building a third project and that's going to be a landing page. Most likely, it will take me more than a day to complete it.

### Day 41: July 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added video, images, logo, and header color of landing page.

**Thoughts** I swear - I will never understand how the header thing works. I don't why I cannot hide the small gaps on the header. I even copied line by line CSS scripts from my previous projects and it's still there. Whoever said CSS is easy has to apologize all developers in the world!

### Day 42: July 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added border layout of pricing section for landing page.

**Thoughts** Only 4 user stories are left before the test atr all green. Beside layouts which I will get back to it later, there are two contents I frankly don't what it is and need to learn more about it. And they are: submitting email to URL provided by FFC and clicking a button that will take to the corresponding section of the page. Technically, I did the second one, but for some reason, it's passing the test.

### Day 43: July 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed nav links, email form and added media query of landing page.

**Thoughts** Good grief - I spend 3 hours fixing media query to no avail and turns out it's working just fine on codepen. I don't care when someone says it works on my machine but I'm getting panic when it;s NOT working on my machine! In any case, I completed the project somehow.

### Day 44: July 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started fourth project of FFC.

**Thoughts** There was a black out in my house today so I get to code for 1 hour only. This project looks slightly easier than the third project since I'll use less CSS and no flexbox.

[HTMLdocs](https://mohammedasker.github.io/HTMLdocs/)

### Day 45: July 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added some code snippets and changed menu layout of fourth project for FFC.

**Thoughts** The project is going fine so far and my only pet peeve at the moment is I don't know how I can display code examples in my project. I'm aware that I can use both pre tag and code tag HTML elements, but what I see in the article examples is different from what actually happens in my page. Like I'm not formatting the code properly or worse the blogs failed to mention some critical information. I need to find out more!

[HTMLdocs](https://mohammedasker.github.io/HTMLdocs/)

### Day 46: July 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Passed the tests of fourth project for FFC.

**Thoughts** Phew! I managed to solve most of my problems from passing the test to displaying the code samples. In order to display the code snippets on your web page, you have to use some weird signs in HTML if you want to display the symbol characters. I cannot show you the example right here cause I'm worry I might mess up the journal entry here. Maybe another time.

Tomorrow, I have to make the page mobile friendly and then I will submit the project to the FCC.

### Day 47: July 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made the fourth project responsive and submitted to the FFC.

**Thoughts** It took me a long time to turn the project into mobile friendly and it was not easy at all. Creating the side menu and change it into top menu for mobile screen takes a lot of work than I thought. I guess it will be a while before I can get comfortable building menus and navbars in general.

### Day 48: July 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started building the fifth project of FFC.

**Thoughts** I want to keep the website as simple as possible so I can finish the project quicker. It's almost done and I need to find ways upload images to the internet so I can post it on Codepen.

### Day 49: July 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished building the fifth project of FFC and earned FFC Responsive Web Design certificate.

**Thoughts** I earned my first certificate of Free Code Camp! Yay!! The viewport thing was not clear at all until I stumbled at the forum in FCC. I just had to use vh when setting the height of the welcome section equal to that of viewport. Lesson learned

### Day 50: Aug 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Refactored JS Code codes and solved FreeCodeCamp JavaScript challenges.

**Thoughts** I've got an internship (unrelated to coding) which completely messed up my scheduling and at one point was too tired to touch my smartphone, let alone tweeting my progress. Until I fully get my time back into control, I'll limit myself to code at least 1 hour per day.

### Day 51: Aug 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Refactored JS Dojo variable codes and solved one FreeCodeCamp JavaScript challenges.

**Thoughts** I didn't do it much today cause I'm out of ideas or directions or whatever. What I want to do next is learn queryselector as much as I can and put to into practical use.

### Day 52: Aug 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practicing querySelector by playing around in a dummy page.

**Thoughts** I don't know when and where it will make sense to use querySelector in a real world scenairos. From what I understood, it's basically a faster version of getElementByClassName and getElementById which consumes a lot of time writing when you can use querySelector instead. It's one of the reason why Jquery was created.

### Day 53: Aug 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More practice of querySelector in a dummy page.

**Thoughts** Got no work today, so I was able to code at my usual time. Still trying to get hang on how querySelector works and need more time to fully understand it.

### Day 54: Aug 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Even more practice of querySelector in a dummy page.

**Thoughts** Today was an unproductive day. Made no meaningful progress and feel like I wasted a lot of free time. I'll forgot about querySelector for now and do something else like signing up for JavaScript30 course.

### Day 55: Aug 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practiced bit of arrow functions and started drum kit project.

**Thoughts** Another day. Another unproductive day. I signed up Wes Bos's JavaScript 30 course today to see how ES6 JavaScript can be used to build projects. For some reason, I'm still not feeling condifent with JavaScript even after playing around for more than 2 months. Let's see if this course will help me  to get better understanding of JavaScript.

### Day 56: Aug 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished creating a drum kit project from JavaScript50.

**Thoughts** Not bad. Wes Bos has already prepared HTML and CSS files so that I can focus learning JavaScript50 practicals. I've seen how he used querySelector and querySelectorAll to make changes to the keys. In other words, maybe querySelector and querySelectorAll is better suited for passing logics in nodeLists instead of messing around the DOM like how I normally use getElementsByWhatevers.

### Day 57: Aug 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished creating a clock project from JavaScript30.

**Thoughts** I tried to get minutes and hour hands working with a big failure and how Wes solved it is much simpler than mine. Lol. At least I practice it if nothing else. On another note, he used querySelector and picked up classname element. This begs me a question: Can querySelector pick "Anything" in HTML? I'm eager to know.

### Day 58: Aug 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a lit bit of querySelector.

**Thoughts** Thanks to Wes Bos's JavaScript30 course, I start to understand how querySelector works. Basically, I have to write the element names correctly inside the brackets. For instance, if I want to get id name Hello, I should write #Hello. And if want classname or tagname, I should write .Hello or just Hello. It's more efficient and replaces getElementByWhatevers. The only cost is it does not work on Internet Explorer.

### Day 59: Aug 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Build a CSS Variables from JavaScript30.

**Thoughts** There's a lot of stuff to digest from that project, but it was certainly intersting on how I can use JS to control the CSS and change the looks and effects dynamically. More importantly, he used querySelectorAll to connect three elements at the same time & do cool stuffs. That;s what I want to focus now.

### Day 60: Aug 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Doing an array cardio excrcise JavaScript30.

**Thoughts** That project I'm doing right now might be boring, but it's going to help me to level up my JavaScript skills. If there's one thing to complain, it is that it's for back end and I don't think I will use it for the next year.

### Day 61: Aug 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Start doing Flex Panel Gallery for JavaScript30.

**Thoughts** I finished the array cardio project and gotta say it was pretty daunting working through all these array. But now that I'm back to the main page, I should be able to fun with the visuals again.

### Day 62: Aug 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished doing Flex Panel Gallery for JavaScript30.

**Thoughts** The project itself was not bad, but I'm starting to get confused about the codes and information and... basically everything in the JS30 itself. Maybe because I haven't got the all basics of JavaScript under the belt yet.

### Day 63: Aug 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Solved 12 JavaScript challenges in FFC.

**Thoughts** I've taken a short break from JS30 and do some FFC challenges cause my brain needs some excerise. And there's no any exciting projects I have planned yet. God, what am I doing now?

### Day 64: Aug 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Solved some JavaScript challenges in FFC and learned Flexbox from Traversy Media.

**Thoughts** Flexbox looks much simpler than I thought. There are some projects that I want to replace those annoying floating with cool flexs. On another note, dark themes are just better than light themes.

### Day 65: Aug 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed product landing page using Flexbox.

**Thoughts** Feeling proud of myself today. I withhold my honor and did the FFC landing page correctly without using loophole. This time I actually took the time to learn Flexbox properly and immediately applied to my old project. Flexbox is the best!!!!

### Day 66: Aug 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Trying to make drop down menu.

**Thoughts** Yesterday, I didn't write the journal because I wasted my time on useless things like coming up with project ideas when I should've focused on coding itself.

### Day 67: Aug 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still making drop down menu.

**Thoughts** I cannot believe how hard is to make a mobile drop menu. Creating drop menu itself is ok. Creating an animated sandwich is also ok. But to do both of them at the same time? Not ok. How in the world did so many developers do that?

### Day 68: Aug 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: And yet still making drop down menu and it's getting harder and harder.

**Thoughts** Hamburger menu is so freaking hard to make. I have nothing else to say.

### Day 69: Aug 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Forked and breaking someone's drop down menu.

**Thoughts** Okay, after calming myself down and quietly working on someone's codes, I'm slowly starting to see the dots here and there. This should help me to understand better on building mobile menu.

### Day 70: Sep 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Resume the challenge and practicing queryselectorall.

**Thoughts** I had an internet problem for 2 weeks and so I wasn't able to post my activities on GitHub and coding on-and-off. Now that I'm back I need to make the most of it for the rest of challenge days.

### Day 71: Sep 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More practicing queryselectorall.

**Thoughts** Ok, so I start getting the first clue that I can access nodelist using queryselectorall. To be honest, I don't fully understand how nodelist works, but it can be a key to learn the true power of queryselectorall. Need more practice.

### Day 72: Sep 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Yet another practicing queryselectorall.

**Thoughts** Ok, so I'm starting to get a hang of queryselectorall (which is cool feeling btw) and now I need to find ways of applying this feature into practical use. Like when to use and when not to for example.

Also, I got less than 30 days before I finish 100 days of challenge so I need to make one more project using all the features I've learned so far during the journey of programming.

### Day 73: Sep 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Start building note app.

**Thoughts** I discovered a cool DOM feature called create element and append element in JS which allows you to create that infinte amount of uhhh... many things! Like popping text list you see in to-do list or something ilke that. Basically, I learned how developers make this kind of stuff.

### Day 74: Sep 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: A text is saved and shows as a list when clicked save button.

**Thoughts** OKay, this is getting really cool! I'm building a simple app which is challenging, yet is achievable. I was wondering why Object HTMLTextAreaElement keeps appearing when creating a text, but turns out I forgot to add .value. Oopis!!!

### Day 75: Sep 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Adding a delete button on right side of the note but not working yet.

**Thoughts* And thus the struggle begins... I don't know why my code is not working. Even though I *gasp* copy-and-taste some snippets from the tutorial, it's still not showing the x button. I must make this work no matter!!
