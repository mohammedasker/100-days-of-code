# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Joined the 100 days of code challenge and built calculator using JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: I'm gonna use this opportunity to improve my coding skills and learn JavaScript. This is going to be fun! I also managed to get my calculator to work and need to improve its looks. I think I found a tiny bit of JavaScript patterns.

### Day 1: June 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS and changed the colors of background, display, and buttons.

**Thoughts**: I have learn how tr and td tags in HTML works and it was interesting. I should've put the table tag or these tags won't work. I have yet to figure out how to set custom errors in JavaScript when a user put incorrect inputs.

### Day 2: June 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Not much done. Just reading someone's code.

**Thoughts**: I tried to find ways to get my calculator to display syntax error with no luck. Found myself spending more time on reading someone's code to understand how it works than writing actual codes. I should've clone the codes earlier before the practice time and then break them all into pieces to get the gist of it. No biggie - it's slow day for me.

### Day 3: June 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Reading other people's codes and break it to study its effects.

**Thoughts**: While today I haven't code much, I had fun breaking people's codes and understand how their codes works. Apparently, you can use the header element in HTML to create display screen for the calculator. It was an interesting discovery to say the least.

### Day 4: June 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did some basic JavaScript exercises on FreeCodeCamp to refresh my knwoledge.

**Thoughts**: Yesterday, I joined the CareerDev mentorship program and my new mentor, Steve helped him greatly. It didn't occured to me that I can use console log to analysis what my code is doing under the hood. While I have no idea how it works right now, I'm sure it make a big differences in getting better my coding skills.

### Day 5: June 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did some more JavaScript challenges in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I finally understood why I'm having trouble learning JavaScript. It's because I have no practical uses for it yet, unlike HTML and CSS. From now on, I'll just focus on learning the most basics features used mainly for front-end development.

### Day 6: June 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practicing JavaScript functions by creating dynamic paragraph.

**Thoughts**: I did a very simple task of changing the colors and font size of paragraph using JavaScript functions. Still not easy, however for the first time in a while, I'm actually enjoying this.
