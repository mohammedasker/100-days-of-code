# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Joined the 100 days of code challenge and built calculator using JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: I'm gonna use this opportunity to improve my coding skills and learn JavaScript. This is going to be fun! I also managed to get my calculator to work and need to improve its looks. I think I found a tiny bit of JavaScript patterns.

### Day 1: June 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS and changed the colors of background, display, and buttons.

**Thoughts**: I have learn how tr and td tags in HTML works and it was interesting. I should've put the table tag or these tags won't work. I have yet to figure out how to set custom errors in JavaScript when a user put incorrect inputs.

### Day 2: June 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Not much done. Just reading someone's code.

**Thoughts**: I tried to find ways to get my calculator to display syntax error with no luck. Found myself spending more time on reading someone's code to understand how it works than writing actual codes. I should've clone the codes earlier before the practice time and then break them all into pieces to get the gist of it. No biggie - it's slow day for me.

### Day 3: June 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Reading other people's codes and break it to study its effects.

**Thoughts**: While today I haven't code much, I had fun breaking people's codes and understand how their codes works. Apparently, you can use the header element in HTML to create display screen for the calculator. It was an interesting discovery to say the least.

### Day 4: June 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did some basic JavaScript exercises on FreeCodeCamp to refresh my knwoledge.

**Thoughts**: Yesterday, I joined the CareerDev mentorship program and my new mentor, Steve helped him greatly. It didn't occured to me that I can use console log to analysis what my code is doing under the hood. While I have no idea how it works right now, I'm sure it make a big differences in getting better my coding skills.

### Day 5: June 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did some more JavaScript challenges in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I finally understood why I'm having trouble learning JavaScript. It's because I have no practical uses for it yet, unlike HTML and CSS. From now on, I'll just focus on learning the most basics features used mainly for front-end development.

### Day 6: June 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practicing JavaScript functions by creating dynamic paragraph.

**Thoughts**: I did a very simple task of changing the colors and font size of paragraph using JavaScript functions. Still not easy, however for the first time in a while, I'm actually enjoying this.

### Day 7: June 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Successfully built a simple task of making dynamic paragraph.

**Thoughts**: I cannot believe myself! I actually managed to change the sizes, font style, colors, and position of the paragraph without looking up a tutorial! I only read a guide, played a little bit, came up a tiny task and made it one. Now, I begin to understand a little bit of how to change HTML/CSS using the function feature in JavaScript.

### Day 8: June 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practicing JavaScript functions and learning little bit of console.log.

**Thoughts**: I added a default button that will return changed paragraph to its original form. Seeing how I make this worked through copying snippets of my code then tweaking only the necessary parts and seeing all come out a live is quite satisfying.

### Day 9: June 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practicing JavaScript event listener and begin to build personal website.

**Thoughts** Not gonna lie, I can't tell the difference between eventListener and functions. To me, it seems like they do the same thing, and the differences is the ways of typing the code. I need to explore it more.

### Day 10: June 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still practicing JavaScript event listener.

**Thoughts**: Uhhhhh...nope. I still have no idea what event listener is supposed to do. I guess I should look up the reference for a while. In the meantime, my own website still looking funny and too cringy to post a link in GitHub. Gotta fix 'em later.

### Day 11: June 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: And yet, still practicing JavaScript event listener. But there's progress!

**Thoughts**: And the progress is... while the function and eventlistener do the same thing, the difference is in eventlistener, you don't need to put onclick attribute in HTML since the "Click" in JavaScript will take care in its place (Not that I know why click here is necessary. It gives "syntax error: expecting expression but got ," error message). On unrelated notes, I understood the purpose of const variable - you can change variable names with var or let, but const won't allow you.

### Day 12: June 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Played a little bit of variables today.

**Thoughts**: After tackling functions for a few days, I'm now trying to understand how does the variables works. Outside of storing user data, I want to know where else should I use these variables. This is going to be my next focus point of coding.

Projects? No - no yet. Maybe next month.

### Day 13: June 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Start practicing if statements.

**Thoughts**: Feeling tired today and made no progress in my calculator again. At least, I have a rough idea on where to look for solutions, so I'll take a rest.

**Update**: Change of plans: I'm gonna create a notes app and trying a new approach of solving my coding problems. This new thought has completely energized me and I will make this new project successfil no matter what!!
