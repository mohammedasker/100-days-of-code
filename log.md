# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Joined the 100 days of code challenge and built calculator using JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: I'm gonna use this opportunity to improve my coding skills and learn JavaScript. This is going to be fun! I also managed to get my calculator to work and need to improve its looks. I think I found a tiny bit of JavaScript patterns.

### Day 1: June 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS and changed the colors of background, display, and buttons.

**Thoughts**: I have learn how tr and td tags in HTML works and it was interesting. I should've put the table tag or these tags won't work. I have yet to figure out how to set custom errors in JavaScript when a user put incorrect inputs.

### Day 2: June 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Not much done. Just reading someone's code.

**Thoughts**: I tried to find ways to get my calculator to display syntax error with no luck. Found myself spending more time on reading someone's code to undedrstand how to works than writing actual codes. I should've clone the codes rarlier before the practice time and then break them all into pieces to get the gist of it. No biggie - it's slow day for me.
