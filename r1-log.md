## Log

### R2D1 - Oct 21 2019

I started the challenge by first learning JSON from my favourite web developmwnt teacher, Brad Traversy. The JSON syntax kind of reminds of CSS. Not too hard I'd say. Just need to find way to use JSON in real situation.

### R2D2 - Oct 22 2019

I started another tutorial called 'Ajax Crash Course' to learn how to send request to HTTP and get me data and son. Yes, I'm still new to it, and I am learning.

### R2D2 - Oct 23 2019

Still continuing from the Ajax course. Nothing newsworthy to say other than getting a first taste in API and PHP.
