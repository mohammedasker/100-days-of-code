# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - Mohammed Asker

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Oct 21, Monday, 2019].

## Log

### R2D1 - Oct 21 2019

I started the challenge by first learning JSON from my favourite web developmwnt teacher, Brad Traversy. The JSON syntax kind of reminds of CSS. Not too hard I'd say. Just need to find way to use JSON in real situation.

### R2D2 - Oct 22 2019

I started another tutorial called 'Ajax Crash Course' to learn how to send request to HTTP and get me data and son. Yes, I'm still new to it, and I am learning.

### R2D3 - Oct 23 2019

Still continuing from the Ajax course. Nothing newsworthy to say other than getting a first taste in API and PHP.

### R2D4 - Oct 24 2019

I finish the Ajax crash course and the important points to remember is XMLHttpRequest, open, onload, and send. As long as I practice them and put them in real project, then I'll be all good. On the side note, I learn a bit of PHP and MySQL and how to send data to the database and fetch from it. I accidently became a full-stack developer.

### R2D5 - Oct 25 2019

I watched one more tutorial of Brad and this time it is fetch. Little bit easier than Ajax, but I guess I'll use them both depending on the project.

### R2D6 - Oct 26 2019

I started a new project called Readwits which is basically a book find web app. I added a layout for the app and it looks good for now. The resl meat of the challenge will begin tomorrow.
